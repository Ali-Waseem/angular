1. # Setup Instructions

To run the application locally, follow the steps below:
a. Ensure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your system.
b. In the project root directory, install the required dependencies:

    "npm install"

c. Once installation is complete, start the development server:

    "ng serve"

d. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the application.

2. # Assumptions and Notes

Based on the instructions in the assignment, I assumed it was acceptable—if not encouraged—to incorporate a theme-based template to enhance the UI/UX and structure of the application. With that in mind, I opted to embed a ready-made theme, which allowed me to focus on functionality, consistency, and responsive design more efficiently.
If this interpretation does not align with expectations, I am open to adjusting the approach or adopting a different design strategy as required.

3. # Potential Improvements with More Time
If given more time, I would focus on the following enhancements:

**Code Quality & Structure**
- Implement more reusable components and services following SOLID principles.
- Improve state management by proper planning and integrating a reactive pattern (e.g., NgRx or SignalStore) for more scalable applications.

**Testing**
- Expand unit test coverage across all services and components.
- Add E2E testing using Cypress or Protractor to simulate user flows.

**Best Practices & Performance**
- Integrate lazy loading more effectively and fine-tune module boundaries.

- Optimize images and assets for performance.

- Introduce form validation improvements and accessibility (a11y) enhancements.

**UI/UX Enhancements**

- Further customize the theme to align with branding guidelines.
- Add animations, loading states, and user-friendly feedback (e.g., confirmations, tooltips).

**Modern Angular Practices**

- Upgrade to the latest Angular version if not already.
- Utilize standalone components and signals for cleaner, more modern architecture.

My aim would be to refine the solution not just from a technical standpoint, but also to ensure long-term maintainability, performance, and usability.
